# Football360

This is the official repository for the Football360 dataset. The aim of this dataset is to aid the development and evaluation of computer vision algorithms, primarily the radial distortion correction algorithms, in the sports domain.

This dataset contains 268 panorama images, and was created using the PANONO panoramic camera in 3 football arenas in Slovakia. Each arena was covered from numerous locations on all levels of the tribune, and broadcast camera platforms. The images capture regular football game, pitch maintenance, low/challenging lighting conditions, day and night situations.


| Arena           | Number of images |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Bratislava      | 111              |
| Trnava          | 104              |
| Dunajska Streda | 53               |


From these panorama images a high number of crop images conforming to the pinhole camera model can be generated by randomly sampling the camera orientation and focal length. If desired, the generated images can be distorted with a chosen radial distortion model to produce very large training set suitable for neural network training.


## Raw Image Probe

Raw images are stored as 16384x8192 JPG, they are the direct result of the PANONO stitching service.
